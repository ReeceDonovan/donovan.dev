# Personal Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal website - a software development portfolio and photography gallery.

## Technologies Used

The website is built with the following technologies:

- [**Next.js**](https://nextjs.org/): An open-source React framework for building user-friendly and optimized web applications.
- [**TypeScript**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): A strict syntactical superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, making it ideal for larger-scale applications.
- [**TailwindCSS**](https://tailwindcss.com/): A utility-first CSS framework that provides rapid UI development.

## Content and Image Management

The website uses the following services for content and image management:

- [**Sanity.io**](https://www.sanity.io/): A headless CMS platform used to manage structured content for the projects and portfolio content.
- [**Cloudfront**](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/): Amazon CloudFront is used as a fast content delivery network (CDN) service that securely delivers data, videos, applications, and APIs to customers globally.

## Deployment

The website is deployed on [**Vercel**](https://vercel.com/), a platform known for its excellent static and JAMstack deployment, making it an ideal choice for Next.js projects.
